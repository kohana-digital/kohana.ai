            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p> Kohana AI was engaged by a major telecommunications company to improve its customer support experience. We designed and deployed AI-powered chatbots using Natural Language Processing techniques, resulting in a 40% reduction in support staff costs and a significant improvement in customer satisfaction.</p>
            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>The telecommunications company, a leading player in the industry, was facing challenges in managing its growing customer base and the increasing complexity of support inquiries. The company's customer support team was struggling to keep up with the high volume of calls and chat requests, leading to long wait times and customer dissatisfaction. The management was looking for innovative solutions to enhance the customer experience while optimizing operational costs.</p>
            <h3>Solution</h3>
            <p>Kohana AI partnered with the telecommunications company to analyze their customer support operations and identify opportunities for improvement. We proposed the implementation of AI-powered chatbots to automate the handling of routine support inquiries, allowing human agents to focus on more complex issues.</p>
            <p>Our team of experts designed and developed the chatbot solution using Natural Language Processing techniques and Large Language Models like ChatGPT. This enabled the chatbot to understand customer queries and provide accurate responses in a conversational manner. We also incorporated a seamless escalation mechanism, allowing the chatbot to transfer conversations to human agents when necessary.</p>
            <p>The chatbot was integrated into the company's existing customer support platforms, including their website, mobile app, and social media channels, providing customers with multiple touchpoints for assistance.</p>
            <h3>Results</h3>
            <p>Upon deployment of the AI-powered chatbots, the telecommunications company experienced significant improvements in their customer support operations:</p>
